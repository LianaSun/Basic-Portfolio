        <p>Hi! I'm Liana Morrison and I'm currently enrolled at the University of Minnesotas Coding Bootcamp. I have a BA in Dietetics and an Applied MBA in Small Business & Entreprentureship. For the last 12 years, I've managed yoga studios across the country and have cotnractd with over 25 studios. I have taught over 6,000 classes and lead over 50 workshops, privates and events. My clients have included Lady Gaga and Peter Van Der Deen. I currently partner with a boutique studio in Minneapolis - Open Minds Fusion Studio. My passion project is the Minnesota Dancers Collective, which promotes safer, earlier Dance Parties throughout the twin cities.</p>
        <p> I'm also a mom to the best 5-year old girl in the world and our family includes a 5 year-old Corgi-mix named Penny and a Western Hognose Snake named Magical.</p>
        <p>The snake in my bio pic is from our friend, Emily's collection - an 8ft boa constrictor named Doug!</p>
